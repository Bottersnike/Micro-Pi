  "body": "##Summary\r\nMicro:Pi is a pure python IDE (Intergrated\r\nDevelopment Enviroment) designed to run on any system\r\nwith python. It has a simple interface and contains a whole\r\nbox of tricks such as the serial monitor and image sender/reciver.\r\n\r\n##Why use Micro:Pi over alternatives?\r\nMicro:Pi can run entirely offline if you want to. It downloads all\r\nof its dependancys at install time and from that point on no\r\ninternet connection is required. Micro:Pi also allows you to program\r\nyour BBC Micro:Bit in C++ which is usually only avaliable through\r\ncommand line interfaces (which Micro:Pi does for you). It also comes\r\nwith a built in serial monitor and it's entierly open source.\r\n\r\n##Instalation\r\nTo install Micro:Pi there is a new script bundled. Open a terminal\r\nin the root folder of Micro:Pi then type `./install.sh`. It has to\r\nbe run as root so `sudo sh install.sh` is recommended. Uninstalling\r\nin done by the `uninstall.sh` script and in run in the same way.\r\nIf you want to install Micro:Pi without having to download it, type\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Bottersnike/Micro-Pi.git\r\nsudo sh install.sh\r\n```\r\nand it should install.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- In the top left corner are 4 triangles that indicate the statud of you\r\n    Micro:Bit. It goes green if your Micro:Bit is found, orange if\r\n    it's uploading, and red is if Micro:Pi can't find you Micro:Bit.\r\n- Just underneath the 4 triangles, is your tab view. This allows you to\r\n    create multiple files in your project.\r\n- The large white box in the top half of the screen is your text editor.\r\n    This is where you write your code to put on your Micro:Bit\r\n- Just under that, is where you can find your console. This shows the output\r\n    of the build and upload process. Errors will appear here.\r\n- In the deploy menu, you can find the serial monitor. From here you can\r\n    send and recieve text from your BBC Micro:Bit.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\nI don't have a PayPal or anything similar but the best way you can contribute\r\nis by just letting people know about Micro:Pi and getting it out.\r\n\r\n##Thanks To:\r\n- The MBED team for developing yotta and alot of the build process\r\n- Lancaster University for the microbit-dal runtime that this entire project is built upon\r\n- Joe Finney from Lancaster Uni. for helping me when I was facing problems settings up yotta on my pi\r\n- The entire Raspberry Pi Forums community for answering all my questions\r\n",
