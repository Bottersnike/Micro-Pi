  "body": "##Summary\r\nMicro:Pi is a pure python IDE (Intergrated\r\nDevelopment Enviroment) designed to run on any system\r\nwith python. It has a simple interface and contains a whole\r\nbox of tricks such as the serial monitor and image sender/reciver.\r\n\r\n##Why use Micro:Pi over alternatives?\r\nMicro:Pi can run entirely offline if you want to. It downloads all\r\nof its dependancys at install time and from that point on no\r\ninternet connection is required. Micro:Pi also allows you to program\r\nyour BBC Micro:Bit in C++ which is usually only avaliable through\r\ncommand line interfaces (which Micro:Pi does for you). It also comes\r\nwith a built in serial monitor and it's entierly open source.\r\n\r\n##Instalation\r\nTo install Micro:Pi there is a new script bundled. Open a terminal\r\nin the root folder of Micro:Pi then type `./install.sh`. It has to\r\nbe run as root so `sudo sh install.sh` is recommended. Uninstalling\r\nin done by the `uninstall.sh` script and in run in the same way.\r\nIf you want to install Micro:Pi without having to download it all first,\r\ndownload the install.sh file then run\r\n```\r\nsudo sh install.sh --online\r\n```\r\nand it should download and install.\r\n\r\nIf you are on a non linux system, download this repository from github\r\nthen download and install the following:\r\n- python 2.7 [https://www.python.org/.../python-2.7.12.msi](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.msi)\r\n- pyGTK2.0 All In One[http://ftp.gnome.org/.../pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi)\r\n    (Be sure to check PyGtkSourceView2 2.10.1 in the installation window)\r\n- yotta [https://mbed-media.mbed.com/.../yotta_install_v023.exe](https://mbed-media.mbed.com/filer_public/2f/0b/2f0b924c-1fac-4907-989b-f2afe3f5785e/yotta_install_v023.exe)\r\n- gcc-arm-none-eabi [https://launchpad.net/.../gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q2-20150609-win32.exe](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q2-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q2-20150609-win32.exe)\r\n\r\nNow you need to add the location where you installed yotta (C:\\yotta by\r\ndefault) and the \\bin directory of you gcc-arm-none-eabi installation to\r\nyour global path. Instructions for adding to you path can be found at\r\n[http://yottadocs.mbed.com/#windows-path](http://yottadocs.mbed.com/#windows-path).\r\nIf you want you can also remove the \"Run Yotta\" shortcut from your\r\ndesktop as you don't need it.\r\n\r\nYou can then start micropi using\r\n```\r\ncd micropi\r\npython micropi.py\r\n```\r\nAn install script for windows is planned by is made hard because windows\r\ndoesn't have a package manager.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- In the top left corner are 4 triangles that indicate the statud of you\r\n    Micro:Bit. It goes green if your Micro:Bit is found, orange if\r\n    it's uploading, and red is if Micro:Pi can't find you Micro:Bit.\r\n- Just underneath the 4 triangles, is your tab view. This allows you to\r\n    create multiple files in your project.\r\n- The large white box in the top half of the screen is your text editor.\r\n    This is where you write your code to put on your Micro:Bit\r\n- Just under that, is where you can find your console. This shows the output\r\n    of the build and upload process. Errors will appear here.\r\n- In the deploy menu, you can find the serial monitor. From here you can\r\n    send and recieve text from your BBC Micro:Bit.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\nI don't have a PayPal or anything similar but the best way you can contribute\r\nis by just letting people know about Micro:Pi and getting it out.\r\n\r\n##Thanks To:\r\n- The MBED team for developing yotta and alot of the build process\r\n- Lancaster University for the microbit-dal runtime that this entire project is built upon\r\n- Joe Finney from Lancaster Uni. for helping me when I was facing problems settings up yotta on my pi\r\n- The entire Raspberry Pi Forums community for answering all my questions\r\n",
