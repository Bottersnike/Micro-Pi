<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>Micro:Pi is a pure python IDE (Intergrated
Development Enviroment) designed to run on any system
with python. It has a simple interface and contains a whole
box of tricks such as the serial monitor and image sender/reciver.</p>

<a id="why-use-micropi-over-alternatives" class="anchor" href="#why-use-micropi-over-alternatives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why use Micro:Pi over alternatives?</h2>

<p>Micro:Pi can run entirely offline if you want to. It downloads all
of its dependancys at install time and from that point on no
internet connection is required. Micro:Pi also allows you to program
your BBC Micro:Bit in C++ which is usually only avaliable through
command line interfaces (which Micro:Pi does for you). It also comes
with a built in serial monitor and it's entierly open source.</p>

<h2>
<a id="instalation" class="anchor" href="#instalation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instalation</h2>

<p>To install Micro:Pi there is a new script bundled. Open a terminal
in the root folder of Micro:Pi then type <code>./install.sh</code>. It has to
be run as root so <code>sudo sh install.sh</code> is recommended. Uninstalling
in done by the <code>uninstall.sh</code> script and in run in the same way.
If you want to install Micro:Pi without having to download it, type</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Bottersnike/Micro-Pi.git
sudo sh install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>and it should install.</p>

<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>In the top left corner are 4 triangles that indicate the statud of you
Micro:Bit. It goes green if your Micro:Bit is found, orange if
it's uploading, and red is if Micro:Pi can't find you Micro:Bit.</li>
<li>Just underneath the 4 triangles, is your tab view. This allows you to
create multiple files in your project.</li>
<li>The large white box in the top half of the screen is your text editor.
This is where you write your code to put on your Micro:Bit</li>
<li>Just under that, is where you can find your console. This shows the output
of the build and upload process. Errors will appear here.</li>
<li>In the deploy menu, you can find the serial monitor. From here you can
send and recieve text from your BBC Micro:Bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have a PayPal or anything similar but the best way you can contribute
is by just letting people know about Micro:Pi and getting it out.</p>
