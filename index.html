            <h2 id="whatisit">Summary</h2>
            <p>Micro:Pi is a pure python IDE (Intergrated
            Development Enviroment) designed to run on any system
            with python. It has a simple interface and features
            including built in examples, file inporting, and even
            different themes to suit how you are feeling.</p>
            <h2 id="whyuseit">Why use Micro:Pi over alternatives?</h2>
            <p>For starters, once you have donloaded the yotta
            build setup (included with the pip package) it's
            entirely offline and doens't require any internet
            connection at all. Seccondly, it is an IDE for C++. C++
            if the langauge that all of the other editors are build
            arround, but none of them atchually allow you to
            program in it. All except for Micro:Pi! Other than that
            it is self contained, simple to use, contains lots of
            little features to speed up your day. And, oh! Did I
            mention that it's open source?</p>
            <h2 id="install">Instalation</h2>
            <p>On a raspberry pi (the intended platform) it's
            simple. Open up a terminal and type the following:</p>
            <pre>sudo apt-get install srecord cmake ninja-build
sudo pip install micropi</pre>
            <p>Then to start it simple type <code>sudo micro-pi</code>
            into a terminal window.<br>On other platforms, you may need
            to download and install cmake, ninja-build and
            srecord manually, but Micro:Pi can still be installed
            with pip. On Windows (also posiably mac) you need to
            run <code>python -m micropi</code> to start it. If pip is
            unavaliable, you can download the .zip file from
            the <a href="http://warehouse.python.org/project/MicroPi">PyPi Warehouse</a>, extract
            it, then run <code>python setup.py install</code></p>

            <list>
                <li>In the top left corner are 4 triangles that
                indicate the statud of you Micro:Bit. You highligh
                colour to say it's plugged in. Orange if it's uploading,
                and red is if Micro:Pi can't find you Micro:Bit.</li>
                <li>Just underneath the 4 triangles, is your tab view.
                This allows you to create multiple files in your
                project.</li>
                <li>On the far right are 4 icons. From left to right
                they are, build, build and upload, toggle console and
                menu.</li>
                <li>The menu can be shown by clicking the menu icon and
                in it you have the option to do things like save, load
                and quit, but there are also some things like "import
                file" which allows you to add a file to your workspace
                and "reset build" which resets the enviroment in which
                Micro:Pi creates your finished code.</li>
                <li>If you hover over "Examples" a submenu appears from
                which you can chose pre-made examples to help you get
                started.</li>
                <li>If you click on settings from the menu, you will
                be greeted with the screen show in the screen shot and
                the options are as follows:
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Quick Start</td>
                        <td>This toggles whether to reset the build
                        enviroment every time you start Micro:Pi. It
                        is reccomended to put this on and just use
                        "Rest Build" from the menu if you need to</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Micro:Bit Location</td>
                        <td>This is where Micro:Pi tries to fond your
                        Micro:Bit. On windows change it to something
                        like "E:\" or whatevery your Micro:Bit's drive
                        letter is. (Use the arrow keys to move the
                        cursor)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Theme</td>
                        <td>Use the round buttons to select your chosen
                        theme.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                </li>
                <li>The large white box in the top half of the screne
                is your text editor. This is where you write your code
                to put on your Micro:Bit</li>
                <li>Just under that, if you have the console toggled on,
                is the console. Here you will see status on how build is
                doing and any errors in your code.</li>
            </list>
            <h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
            <p>If you want to contribute, then at the moment there isn't
            a paypal button or anything like that, but if you are any
            good at art then you could contribute by creating some new
            buttons for the top right. At the moment, they are a bit
            rubish and are only really placeholders. Also you could
            create some more splash screens as veriety is cool. This
            website could also do with some work if someone is willing
            to put in the time. In fact, if you really wanted you could
            help with the code because things like dragging to select
            text, copy/paste, Xscroll aren't yet implemented. You can
            find the source code either at <a href="http://github.com/Bottersnike/MicroPi">http://github.com/Bottersnike/MicroPi</a>
            or by downloading the zip from <a href="http://warehouse.python.org/project/MicroPi">http://warehouse.python.org/project/MicroPi</a>. If you
            have created something, you can email it to me at
