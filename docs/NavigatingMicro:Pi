#Navigating Micro:Pi
##The Editor
In the center of the Micro:Pi interface, is the main text editor. This
consists of multiple files that you can switch between. To add a new file,
go to the "File" section of the menubar and click "Add Page"
##The Console
The console is positioned at the bottom of the interface and is where you
will see the output of the compiling and uploading process. Using the bar
between the text editor and the console, you can resize them accordingly.
##The Menubar
The menubar has alot of different features so I'm going to go through each
one menu by menu.
###File
####New Project
This will create a new Micro:Pi project and will open it in a new window.
####Add Page
As covered in "The Editor", this will add a new file to you current project.
####Examples
In this submenu, you can find all sorts of different examples to help you
learn how to program your BBC Micro:Bit
####Import File
This will allow you to select an allready file to add to your project.
####Open
This allows you to open an existing project in a new window.
####Save
Save will save you project if you have allready saved it before. If it is
a new project, then "Save" will do the same as "Save As"
####Save As
Save As will open a window allowing you to chose a location where you would
like to save you current project.
####Quit
Quit will quit Micro:Pi
###Edit
####Undo and Redo
Undo and Redo will, you guesed it, undo and redo what you type. They **WILL
NOT** undo or redo file deletion.
####Cut, Copy and Paste
I'm not going to exmplain these three. If you really don't know, look them
up on Google.
####Select All
Like the other in the "Edit" menu, "Select All" does what it says on the
tin; it select all text.
####Preferances
Preferances will open the settings editor where you can change things like
the theme and the BBC Micro:Bit location. There is more information on the
settings editior later on in this file.
###View
####Show Line Numbers
This will toggle line numbers to the left of your current file.
####Auto Indent
This toggles wether Micro:Pi will automaticly indent new lines to the same
level as the previous line.
####Tab Width
This allows you to chose the number of spaces that constitute for a tab.
###Deploy
####Build
Build will compile your code, but will not upload it to your BBC Micro:Bit
####Build and Upload
Build and Upload will compile your code and will then try to upoad it to
your BBC Micro:Bit. It will show an error if it can't find the Micro:Bit.
####Force Upload
This will attempt to upload a previously compiled file to your BBC Micro:Bit
without compiling the current project.
####Serial Monitor
This will open the serial monitor of which there is more information later
on in this document.
###Help
####Website
This will open the Micro:Pi website in your prefered browser.
####About
This will show credits and the license.
##The Settings Dialog
The settings dialog allows you to customise Micro:Pi
###BBC Micro:Bit Location
This is where Micro:Pi will look to find your BBC Micro:Bit.
###Quickstart
Quiststart is enabled by default but if dissabled, Micro:Pi will delete
your entire build enviroment, download a new one, and compile it. This means
that your enviroment will always be up to date, but Micro:Pi will take about
5 minutes to start every time.
###Theme
Switching this toggles between the light and dark theme. It is dark by default.
##The Serial Monitor
The serial monitor is your way of communicating with your BBC Micro:Bit
once you have put code onto it. On the far left if the baudrate. By default
this is 115200 for the BBC Micro:Bit but it can be changed if you are using
the serial monitor for another device (for example an Arduino). Next to
that is the "Refresh" button. This scans your computer for any serial devices
that Micro:Pi can comunicate with. To the right of that is the "Clear" button
which will just clear the serial monitor. After that is the device selection
area. After the refresh button is pressed, all detected devices appear here.
Once you have selected you device, click connect to connect with it.
To use the serial monitor, you require code that sends or recieves data.
Examples of these can be found in the "Examples" menu.
