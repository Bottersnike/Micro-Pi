# Micro:Pi
##What is it?
Micro:Pi is a minimal IDE for the BNC Micro:Bit written in pure python. It has features like a build in emulator (planned), an easy to use interface and a quick and simple build process.
##Why is it any better than the online editors?
For starters, it's entirely offline. Once you have all your modules downloaded you can just keep in programming u till you run out of ideas. Other than that, it allows you to program in pure C++ using the Micro:Bit runtimes that all of the online editors are built around. This means that you have complete control as to what your Micro:Bit does and the only limit is your imagination (and file size..)
